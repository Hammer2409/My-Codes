This program will read the file (in.txt) and copy its contents to file (out.txt). It will check if the file (in.txt) exists and will 
give as error messages if failed to read. It will prompt the user to inter an integer and save that a variable. Also, it will keep 
count of the number of integers read from file (in.txt) and will display it to the user.
